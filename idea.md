# Notely — Offline-First Notes Web App

## Idea
Notely is a minimal, offline-first notes web application designed for distraction-free writing.
Users can create, edit, and manage notes even without an internet connection.
When connectivity is restored, notes automatically sync with the backend.

The application also includes AI-assisted features to improve productivity, such as
automatic summarization, title generation, and smart tagging.
